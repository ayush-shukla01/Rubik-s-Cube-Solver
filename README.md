# 1. General Info
 This project is an attempt to implement the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07470.
  
 A 3x3 Rubik's Cube has 4.33x10¬π‚Åπ distinct state, with only one goal state. A brute froce search approach for solving the cube will be highly impractical. In this project, Autodidactic Iteration (ADI) algorithm was used to train the model. ADI is an iterative supervised learning which trains a deep neural network which takes in inpui state s and outputs a value, policy pair.  The policy output p is a vector containing the move probabilities for each of the 12 possible moves from that state. Once the network is trained, the policy is used to reduce breadth and the value is used to reduce depth in the MCTS.

# 2. Data Representation
 In order to solve 3x3 cube using model we have to take two entities into consideration: actions and states.
 
 **Actions**
 Actions are the possible rotations we can perform on any given cube state. We can perform 12 actiions in total, 6 clockwise and 6 anti-clockwise. The naiming of the actions is based on the cube side side we are rotating( left, right, top, bottom, front and back) and type of rotation( clockwise and anti-clockwise).
 
 **States**
 A state is a particular configuration of the colors(cube stickers) and the size of our state space is really huge( 4.33x10¬π‚Åπ distinct state). While trying to solve the cube, the model needs to keep track of 20 x 24 tensors for every state of the cube. This 20 x 24 is derived based on the cubelets and their respective color combination that we need to keep track of. For every state of the cube, we only to keep track of the cube stickers marked with white in the figure below:

                             Stickers we need to track in the cube are marked with white
 We only keep track of the corner and side cuibelets as the central cubelets can only rotate and not change their relaticve positions. Each corner cubelet, has 3 color stickers on it. In order to precisely, indicate the position and orientation of the corner cube, we have 8x3 = 24 combinations. For the 12 side cubelets, we have only 2 color stickers. Which again gives us 12x2 = 24 combinations- Therefore, we have 20 cubelets with each having 24 possible positons.
 
 # 3. Training
 While training the model, we start from goal state and apply sequence of random transformations of some pre-defined length N. This gives us sequence of N states where for each state we perform the following procedure:
 - apply the 12 transformations to the state s
 - pass these 12 new states to the neural network and ask for the "value" of each state. This gives us 12 values for every sub-state of state s.
 - Then target value for state s is calulated as  v·µ¢ = max‚Çê(v(s·µ¢,a)+R(A(s·µ¢,a)))  where A(s·µ¢,a) is the state after action a is performed on state s·µ¢ and R(s·µ¢) equals 1 for goal state and -1 otherwise
 - target policy for state s is calculated using the same formula, but instead of max we take argmax: p·µ¢ = argmax‚Çê (v(s·µ¢,a)+R(A(s·µ¢,a))). Our target policy will have 1 at the position of maximum value for sub-state and 0 on all other positions.
 
 This process is illustrated in the following figure from paper:

# Training
In order to train the model, you need to pass arguments while running the train.py file in the terminal. You will need to pass the .ini files in "-i"  option which contains all the parameters for training. You will need to pass the name of the run in -n option 

`python ./train.py -i ini/cube2x2-zero-goal-d200.ini -n run1`

# Testing 
You need to pass parameters in order to run solver.py, they are:
- the type of cube you want to solve by passing cube2x2 or cube3x3 to -e option. 
-  the model that you have trained to needs to be passed to-m option. 
- Time-limit in seconds needs to be passed to '--max-time' option 
- and step-limit to '--max-steps' option. 
- Pass '--cuda' option in order to enable cuda.
- Pass -i option, if you want to read permutation from a text file as input
- Pass -p option, in order to solve a single scrambled cube where the actions to scramble the cube are seperated by comma. Eg: -p 2,7,10,1,6
- Pass -r option in order generate random scrambled cube of a given depth
- Pass --plot option in order to produce plots of test results
- Pass -o option along with .csv file name, to generate output csv file of the cubes solved by model.
